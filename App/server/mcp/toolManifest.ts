/*
 * Single source of truth for the built-in Genosyn MCP tool manifest.
 *
 * Every entry describes one tool the `genosyn` MCP server exposes: its name,
 * a model-facing description, and a JSON-Schema for the arguments. The
 * server-side handler for each tool lives in `routes/mcpInternal.ts` at
 * `POST /tools/<name>` — the endpoint is always derived from the name, so it
 * is not stored here.
 *
 * Two consumers read this manifest:
 *   - the in-process agent (`services/agent/tools/genosyn.ts`), which maps each
 *     entry to a model tool and dispatches calls to `POST /tools/<name>`; and
 *   - the external Streamable-HTTP endpoint (`routes/mcpConnect.ts`), which
 *     imports it directly to answer `tools/list` for outside MCP clients.
 *
 * Integration-backed tools (Stripe, Gmail, ...) are NOT here — they are
 * discovered per-employee at runtime via `POST /integrations/_list`.
 *
 * When you add a tool: add its handler in `mcpInternal.ts` AND an entry here.
 * Nothing else needs to change — both transports pick it up automatically.
